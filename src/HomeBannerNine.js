            <p className="text-center">Escape the unexpected at one of our three private glamping sites. Nestled on our sprawling,
private property, the Hideaway at Cooper Lake is just an hour drive from Chicago or twenty minutes from Valparaiso. Camp in style or host your next private event!
            </p>
            <p className="text-center">A private,
winding lane leads you to Cooper Lake, our family owned and operated property designed for children and adults, alike. “Unplug” during your stay – but do so with many of
the comforts of a traditional hotel!
If you're enticed by the idea of
camping,
but
don't want to
deal with the work that comes with it, glamping (or glamorous camping) is the perfect
compromis</p>
